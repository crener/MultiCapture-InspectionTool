# MultiCapture-InspectionTool

This is a tool that allows inspection and interaction with a [MultiCapture](https://github.com/crener/MultiCapture) device. This is anything from moving images from the capture device to the computer, looking at log files (from the capture device), sending commands directly to the capture device, camera calibration, etc.
